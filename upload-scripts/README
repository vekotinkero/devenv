READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY YOU DUMBASS!

Here are scripts for uploading progarms to Saker.

STEP 1 - START BOOTLOADER:
Hold S101 while connecting USB-cable to Saker or
while pressing S100. 

This will start the bootloader. Not LEDs should blink now.

STEP 2 - UPLOAD:
Use Desktop Launcher or
using Terminal 

sudo /home/$USER/upload-scripts/upload

The script will guide you...

STEP 3 - VERIFY:
You'll see when it starts uploading. It should output something like this:
 
	Opening port /dev/ttyUSB0, baud 500000
	Reading data from ./border-router-cc2538-254ghz.bin
	Cannot auto-detect firmware filetype: Assuming .bin
	Connecting to target...
	CC2538 PG2.0: 512KB Flash, 32KB SRAM, CCFG at 0x0027FFD4
	Primary IEEE Address: 00:12:4B:00:06:16:0E:09
	Erasing 524288 bytes starting at address 0x00200000
	    Erase done
	Writing 524288 bytes starting at address 0x00200000
	Write 16 bytes at 0x0027FFF0F8
	    Write done                                
	Verifying by comparing CRC32 calculations.
	    Verified (match: 0xb4cd6eae)

You might also get following errors:

ERROR: No serial port found.
	Your USB cable is not connected or 
	it was connected before VMWare was started, 
	i.e. Linux can't find the serial device. Try reconnecting.

ERROR: Timeout waiting for ACK/NACK after 'Synch (0x55 0x55)'
	Bootloader not started properly. See STEP 1.

In case of errors, try again. Good luck!
